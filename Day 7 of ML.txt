What Is Regression?
Regression searches for relationships among variables. For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on their features, such as experience, education level, role, city of employment, and so on.
This is a regression problem where data related to each employee represents one observation. The presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features, while the salary depends on them.
Similarly, you can try to establish the mathematical dependence of housing prices on area, number of bedrooms, distance to the city center, and so on.
Generally, in regression analysis, you consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that at least one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.
In other words, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.

The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses. The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, regressors, or predictors.
Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable. The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even categorical data such as gender, nationality, or brand.
It‚Äôs a common practice to denote the outputs with ùë¶ and the inputs with ùë•. If there are two or more independent variables, then they can be represented as the vector ùê± = (ùë•‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, ùë•·µ£), where ùëü is the number of inputs.

When Do You Need Regression?
Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent experience or gender impacts salaries.
Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.

Regression is used in many different fields, including economics, computer science, and the social sciences. Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of data and increased awareness of the practical value of data
Linear Regression Learning the Model
Learning a linear regression model means estimating the values of the coefficients used in the representation with the data that we have available.
In this section we will take a brief look at four techniques to prepare a linear regression model. This is not enough information to implement them from scratch, but enough to get a flavor of the computation and trade-offs involved.
There are many more techniques because the model is so well studied. Take note of Ordinary Least Squares because it is the most common method used in general. Also take note of Gradient Descent as it is the most common technique taught in machine learning classes.

1. Simple Linear Regression
With simple linear regression when we have a single input, we can use statistics to estimate the coefficients.
This requires that you calculate statistical properties from the data such as means, standard deviations, correlations and covariance. All of the data must be available to traverse and calculate statistics.
This is fun as an exercise in excel, but not really useful in practice.


2. Ordinary Least Squares
When we have more than one input we can use Ordinary Least Squares to estimate the values of the coefficients.
The Ordinary Least Squares procedure seeks to minimize the sum of the squared residuals. This means that given a regression line through the data we calculate the distance from each data point to the regression line, square it, and sum all of the squared errors together. This is the quantity that ordinary least squares seeks to minimize.
This approach treats the data as a matrix and uses linear algebra operations to estimate the optimal values for the coefficients. It means that all of the data must be available and you must have enough memory to fit the data and perform matrix operations.
It is unusual to implement the Ordinary Least Squares procedure yourself unless as an exercise in linear algebra. It is more likely that you will call a procedure in a linear algebra library. This procedure is very fast to calculate.

3. Gradient Descent
When there are one or more inputs you can use a process of optimizing the values of the coefficients by iteratively minimizing the error of the model on your training data.

This operation is called Gradient Descent and works by starting with random values for each coefficient. The sum of the squared errors are calculated for each pair of input and output values. A learning rate is used as a scale factor and the coefficients are updated in the direction towards minimizing the error. The process is repeated until a minimum sum squared error is achieved or no further improvement is possible.

When using this method, you must select a learning rate (alpha) parameter that determines the size of the improvement step to take on each iteration of the procedure.

Gradient descent is often taught using a linear regression model because it is relatively straightforward to understand. In practice, it is useful when you have a very large dataset either in the number of rows or the number of columns that may not fit into memory.
